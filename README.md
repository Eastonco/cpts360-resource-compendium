# cpts-360-resource-compendium

This repo is a collection of resources that we (The TA's of CS360 Spring 2022), wish were readily available to us when we took the course. In our shared experience, CS360 is a great class but the barrier of entry can be quite high due to the high learning curve needed to get up to speed on the assignments. This compendium will hopefully address as many common pitfalls as we can. 

# A Statement to Current Students:
You got this. 


# A Call To Make CS360 Better
If you are takign CS360 and find or create a resource that could potentially help future students please make a pull request or email it to one of the CS360 TA's (silas.stokes@wsu.edu, zachary.nett@wsu.edu or emma.mickas@wsu.edu)
